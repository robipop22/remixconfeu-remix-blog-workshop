# Build and Launch a personal blog using Remix and Vercel

This repository will help you build and launch a personal blog using Remix and Vercel.

We will try to achieve the following:

- Setup a Remix Project with a predefined stack
- Install additional dependencies
- Read content from GiHub
- Display Content from GitHub
- Parse the content and load it within our app using mdx-bundler
- Create separate blog post page to have them displayed standalone
- Add filters on the initial list of blog posts
  Prerequisites

In the end we want to have a fully functional blog that will be deployed to Vercel and its content will be read from GitHub.
Every time we want to add a new blog post we will just add a new file to our GitHub repository and the blog will be updated automatically.
